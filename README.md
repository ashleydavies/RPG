OrthoRPG
========

OrthoRPG is a temporary name for a project of mine aiming to create a fantasy RPG with the hopeful non-content creation date (I.e. engine completion) of within 1 year. I am hoping to then pump in a storyline and content within a year of this. Depending on motivation and free time, a game may actually even be completed within a year rather than within two years.

The engine will be produced heavily inspired by Jeff Vogel's Geneforge and Avernum series' of games.

See /resources/data/human interfacing (..planning) for some basic planning files.

The game will be heavily dialog-driven, with each dialog being a lot more than the typical "Ok. Ok. Ok. Yes. Ok. No." dialog you get in most games and each dialog may have many replies, all doing any number of different things (Playing a sound, spawning an enemy, increasing a stat) dependant on any number of conditions and this will create a very immersive and dynamic experience for the player. The decisions you make throughout the story will influence how people speak to you and your diplomacy with different factions/villages/whatever. My friend has informed me that this is similar to Mass Effect in principle but I cannot confirm that, not having played it myself.
