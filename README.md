RPG
========

This is an RPG project I'm developing in my free time. Currently I've implemented dialog, pathfinding, movement and an assortment of other features.

Ultimately, the main aim for the game is to have gameplay inspired by that of http://www.spidweb.com/ 's games; whereby the dialog and storyline is the main focus.

I'm planning on making a basic skeleton game to model the engine around before creating an actual game; ergo the generic repository name.

Game implementations should be almost entirely XML/Properties-based and thus the engine should be very versatile and powerful.
