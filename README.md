RPG
========

This is an RPG project I'm developing in my free time. Currently I've implemented dialog, pathfinding, movement and an assortment of other features. Ultimately, the main aim for the game is to have gameplay inspired by that of http://www.spidweb.com/ 's games; whereby the dialog and storyline is the main focus, with graphics taking a backseat.

I'm planning on making a basic skeleton game to model the engine around before creating an actual game; ergo the generic repository name.

STATE OF THE PROJECT
========

As I began this a few years ago while still learning more advanced features of OOP and had quite a few bad practices (Some of which I still haven't totally eased out of) the code is quite a mess, so the main aim right now is to get it in a workable state before continuing.

CURRENT GOALS
========

Refactor to make code maintainable and readable
